DjangoLoginSessionIDExtractorScript
===================================

This is a quick shell script I threw together to extract the SESSION ID that is generated as a result of logging into a Django-based login view. This SESSION ID can then be used, for example, to access login protected pages via automated scripts and tools, such as Apace Benchmark.
